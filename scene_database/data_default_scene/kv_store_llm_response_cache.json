    "return": "The user's preferences regarding excessive sunlight can vary based on individual interests and lifestyle choices. However, several common actions tend to emerge from user behavior when faced with bright sunlight. \n\nFirstly, many individuals might opt to seek shade or enter a cooler interior space to escape the harsh rays. This can involve moving to shaded areas outdoors, such as under trees or canopies, or adjusting the environment in their home or office by closing curtains or blinds to limit direct sunlight. This is particularly relevant in regards to low-poly interior designs, where assets like \"LowPolyInterior2_Curtains1_C3\" or \"LowPolyInterior2_Curtains13_C1\" can be utilized to create a more comfortable living space by reducing glare and heat from outside.\n\nAdditionally, some users may prefer to create a more relaxed atmosphere through the use of air conditioning or fans, potentially utilizing virtual assets like the \"LowPolyInterior2_AirConditioner_01.\" The availability of climate control can enhance comfort levels, allowing users to remain productive and relaxed despite the outdoor conditions.\n\nFor those who enjoy the aesthetics of sunlight while minimizing its harsh effects, using decorative elements such as sheer curtains or light fixtures designed for ambient light can be appealing. The integration of indoor plants, as seen with assets like \"LowPolyInterior2_Plant_14\" or \"LowPolyInterior2_Plant_09,\" can also offer a softer aesthetic while contributing to improving the overall atmosphere through the reduction of glaring light.\n\nIn summary, users generally prefer to manage excessive sunlight through seeking shade, utilizing interior design modifications (like curtains or blinds), employing climate control measures, and creatively incorporating aesthetic elements into their environments. Each action reflects a balance between comfort, functionality, and personal style in their living or working space.",
